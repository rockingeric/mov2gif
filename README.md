# mov2gif

## What

mov2gif is a script to covert the screen capture generated by MacOS to .gif (but I am sure it works with any .mov file)

## Why
1. because there is no way to do it natively and i hate to wait for those slow ass online converters
2. ffmpeg parameters can be a bitch to remember

## How

`$ ./mov2gif.sh movie.mov awesome.gif`

the gif name is optional
